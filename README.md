# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment considerations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset, obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It consists of 891 samples and 12 features, including the target variable (Survived), which indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables:
- Missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns are handled using appropriate strategies.
- New features like Title are derived from the Name column.
- Categorical variables like Sex and Embarked are encoded using one-hot encoding.

### Model Development

Two machine learning models, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, are trained on the preprocessed dataset:
- Both models achieve an average cross-validation accuracy of approximately 82%.
- The Gradient Boosting model is selected based on its higher F1-score on the validation set.

### Fine-Tuning

The selected Gradient Boosting model is fine-tuned using grid search for optimal hyperparameters:
- Hyperparameters like the number of estimators and learning rate are tuned to improve model performance.
- The tuned model achieves precision of 76%, recall of 75%, and an F1-score of 0.76 on the validation set.

### Deployment Consideration

Considerations for deploying the model in a production environment include:
- Serialization of the trained model for easy deployment.
- Input data preprocessing to ensure consistency with training data.
- Scalability, monitoring, security, and compliance considerations.

## Conclusion

This project successfully develops and evaluates a predictive model for Titanic survival prediction. It demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment considerations. Further steps include deploying the model in a production environment and monitoring its performance over time.
